# Devcontainer Configuration

This folder contains configuration files required for Codespaces/devcontainers.
Please do not modify its contents unless you know what you are doing and there
is a specific change to the devcontainer configuration you need to make.

If you believe you have a broken configuration or are unsure if you have the
latest version of the configuration, please follow the 
[instructions to add codespaces to your project](https://docs.opensafely.org/getting-started/how-to/add-github-codespaces-to-your-project/).
