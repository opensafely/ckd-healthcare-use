providing primary care data, allowing dataset definitions written using this schema to
run across multiple backends.

This tiny schema is used to write a [minimal dataset definition][smoketest_repo] that
can function as a basic end-to-end test (or "smoke test") of the OpenSAFELY platform
across all available backends.
