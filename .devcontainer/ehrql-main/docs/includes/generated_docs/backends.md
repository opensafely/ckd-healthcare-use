[TPP](https://tpp-uk.com/) are the developers and operators of the
[SystmOne](https://tpp-uk.com/products/) EHR platform. The ehrQL TPP backend
provides access to primary care data from SystmOne, plus data linked from other
sources.

### Patients included in the TPP backend

SystmOne is a primary care clinical information system
used by roughly one third of GP practices in England,
with records for approximately 44% of the English population.

Only patients with a full GMS (General Medical Services) registration are included.

We have registration history for:

* all patients currently registered at a TPP practice
* all patients registered at a TPP practice any time from 1 Jan 2009 onwards:
    * who have since de-registered
    * who have since died

A patient can be registered with zero, one, or more than one practices at a given
time. For instance, students are often registered with a practice at home and a
practice at university.
