    parent_snippet markers are snippets that are intended to be replaced in the parent
    site with appropriate snippet notation.  The snippets themselves do not live in
    this repo.

    on_page_* methods are called for each Page in a mkdocs site and can modify the
    markdown they are given as input.  We're using this method to look for the
    parent_includes markers and replace them with a note box that indicates in the
    built docs that this snippet will be replaced in the full docs build.

    For example:
        !!! parent_snippet:'includes/glossary.md'

    will be replaced with:
        !!! note "TO BE REPLACED IN FULL DOCS BUILD
            This snippet will be replaced in the main docs with the parent file 'includes/glossary.md'

    This allows docs imported from other repos (e.g. ehrql) to reference snippets
    in the parent docs, such as the glossary.
